* History:
** Turing
** legacy: gofai
* GOFAI has dominated popular understanding
* GOFAI has not delivered (because it's mistaken)
* Failure of GOFAI to deliver has fostered the belief that AI is extremely hard to replicate
* People believe something false about ai.
** evidence of complacence
*** (Musk and self-driving cars)
* People are not mindful enough about the incipient arrival full, real ai.
** rate of progress
** if current tech is not fully there, is it a safe bet to assume it's a long way off?
