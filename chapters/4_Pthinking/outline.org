* what is _thinking? (understanding?)
* Digression: recursion
** file system
*** take 1
**** x is a file-system element iff
***** x is a file, or
***** x is a folder
*** x is a folder iff 
**** x is a container can contain files or other folders
***** ie x is a folder iff x is a container of file system elements
*** take 2
**** x is a file-system element iff
***** x is a file, or
***** x is a container of file-system elements
** General form:
*** X is a Y iff
**** X is one of some contained set of simple objects
**** X is a set or list of Y's
** Can easily see how language is recursive
*** p is a language-like sequence iff p is a letter of the alphabet or p is a sequence of p's

* constraints on solution
** don't worry about subjective aspect.
*** just want to know what ...
* Examples
** Making tea
** Commuting to work 
** recognizing a poker hand as a straight (potential straight)
** recognizing a piece as being like Bach / (Van Morrison ?)
* Need:
** at a minimum,
*** recursive pattern generators
*** recursive pattern recognizers
** Patterns:
*** basic vocabulary
*** similarity metric
**** Einstein shirt in youtube by fowler collaborator
** anything else?
** metric over patterns - _same pattern_ ?
*** crude proximity detector
*** there are just patterns
** intermodal patterns: un-ordered associations
** criterion of interestingness.
*** When should patterns be saved?
****  p is interesting iff
***** p is not (nearly) identical to any stored pattern
